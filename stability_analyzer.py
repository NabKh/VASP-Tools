This app is designed to make it easy to perform thermodynamic phase stability analysis using the tools contained in
pymatgen. It enables the user to quickly check if their calculated material is stable using just DFT energies, or stable
under specific environmental conditions of their choosing by setting the chemical potentials of desired gaseous species
as of v1.0, only O and H are supported, but Cl, I, Br, F, and N will soon be added).

Note that it may be reasonable to consider a material "stable" if it is within about 40 meV/formula unit above the
convex hull, however a value closer to 0 is more indicative of good stability.

To obtain DFT energies that are consistent with pymatgen and thus the Materials Project, the user must use GGA-PBE type
pseudopotentials. Also, for compounds containing V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, or Mo, the user must use GGA+U with the following
U values (J=0 for all): {"V": "3.25", "Cr": "3.7", "Mn": "3.9", "Fe": "5.3", "Co": "3.32", "Ni": "6.2", "Mo": "4.38"}.
Fortunately, if you create your input files using the input_file_maker app and specify you're doing a GGA+U calculation,
this will all be taken care of for you.

################################################
General info to use this suite of analysis tools
################################################

You will need the following Python modules installed: VASP_Analyzer, VASP_Setup, VASP_PostProcessing, pymatgen, and
MPinterfaces

VASP_Analyzer, VASP_Setup and VASP_PostProcessing can be obtained from emailing Ryan Jacobs at rjacobs3@wisc.edu
Pymatgen can be downloaded and installed by running the following in your terminal:
    # pip install pymatgen --user
MPinterfaces can be downloaded and installed by running the following in your terminal (note that installation of
version 1.1.2 seems to fail, so version 1.2.0 is used):
    # pip install mpinterfaces=="1.2.0" --user

You will also need to set your Materials API key (obtained from Materials Project) in your .bashrc file as MAPI_KEY.
This can be done by doing the following steps at your terminal:
    # vi ~/.bashrc
    # export MAPI_KEY="abcdefg"

Lastly, you will also need to set the location of your VASP pseudopotentials in your .bashrc file as VASP_PSP_DIR.
If you have installed MAST, this should already be done for you. If not, this can be done by doing the following steps
at your terminal:
    # vi ~/.bashrc
    # export VASP_PSP_DIR="/home/user/vasp_pps"
